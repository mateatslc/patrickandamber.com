							<p>Amber adopted Baxter when she was a young farm kitten. Together, they
made many lonely trips to Petsmart, and Baxter eventually decided she
wanted to start a family.</p>
							<p>Knocked up at the age of one, she became a
teen mom and gave birth to four adorable kittens. She raised them in
Patrick’s apartment and decided to keep Jan as “the chosen one.”</p>
							<p>Despite his disability (he cannot extend his back legs and walks like
a rabbit), he loves to play outside and aspires to be an entomologist.
His favorite movie is Toy Story and he refuses to drink water more
than 30 seconds old.</p>

							<p>Amber adopted 4-month-old Lucie on her 23rd birthday from the Humane
Society of Utah, at a “Dog Days” game at Spring Mobile Ballpark. Lucie
has learned every trick very quickly, but somehow “forgets” to obey
her parents when she is outside or off leash.</p>
							<p>She returned next year
to “Dog Days” at Spring Mobile Ballpark to compete in an eating
contest on top of the dugout, losing a very close match to a gigantic
husky.</p>
							<p>Patrick adopted 10-month-old Porter at another “Dog Days” event
at Spring Mobile Ballpark approximately one month after Amber adopted
Lucie. Porter is a very insistent guard dog, but in his spare time
 you can catch him chasing butterflies.</p>
 							<p> In addition, his height has
bestowed him with the unique ability to sneak food off of the
counter/table tops. You can catch both Porter and Lucie walking around
the stadium during the summer, especially on fireworks nights.</p>

							<p>Patrick was born in Colorado and grew up in Great Falls, Montana. He
attended the University of Minnesota, where he took up competitive
cycling. This interest traveled with him to Utah and culminated in his
participation in Lotoja, a one-day, 208 mile bike race.</p>
							<p>Currently, he
is engaged in the seemingly endless pursuit of a Ph.D. in Neuroscience
at the University of Utah (do not ask him how much time he has left in
school).</p>
							<p>Patrick enjoys hiking, camping, spending time with his pets,
and exploring Utah. He has recently started filling his time with
Clint Eastwood movies and cheap beer. In addition, he is excited about
his recent and long-anticipated purchase of a hammock.</p>

							<p>Amber was born in North Carolina and grew up in Concord, Ohio. After
randomly picking a college in the west, she attended Utah State
University and graduated in 2005.</p>
							<p>She currently works as a “Research
Scientist” in a vision research lab working on glaucoma and loves her
job. Recently she spoke at a national conference called “ARVO” after
being employed only eight months in her lab! One of the many wonderful
things she enjoys about her job is working in the same cubicle as
Patrick, literally one floor above.</p>
							<p>Amber enjoys cycling, an event
that lead her to participate in Lotoja, the same one day trek Patrick
participated in. In her spare time, Amber enjoys reading on her nook,
playing with her pets, exploring Utah, and listening to podcasts about
random information. A future hobby Amber looks forward to pursuing is
riding a tandem bike competitively with Patrick.</p>
